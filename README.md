# regents-races

A fun little exercise to analyse 10k running races in Regent's park.


## Contents

* [Get the data](scrape_data.ipynb) Here we scrape the data from the website and save it into csv format for each individual race

* [Merge the data](merge_data.ipynb) For the analysis, it is easier to work with one dataframe that contains all the information, so I merged the data.

* [Race analysis](race_analysis.ipynb) This is the fun part where we look at data!

## Highlights from analysis

Here are some of the insights
